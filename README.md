# US Political Parties: A Libertarian-Authoritarian Analysis
## Overview
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of the ideological shifts within the major US political parties, focusing on their perspectives towards government roles from a Libertarian-Authoritarian viewpoint. Utilizing the Nolan Chart and data from the American Trends Panel Wave 87 dataset by Pew Research Center, we explore whether the Democratic and Republican parties have converged or diverged along these ideological axes in recent years.

## Introduction
The distinction between the Democratic and Republican parties in the United States has historically centered around their views on the role of government. This project delves into these ideological differences, examining shifts towards or away from libertarian and authoritarian positions, influenced by various political, social, and economic factors.

## Data Source
The analysis is based on the American Trends Panel Wave 87 dataset from **Pew Research Center**, conducted in March 2021. This dataset provides a rich source of demographic and political opinion data from a sample of Americans, weighted to represent the broader population accurately.

## Methodology
**Data Cleaning:** Minimal cleaning was required due to the high quality of the dataset provided by Pew Research Center. The primary task involved wrangling party affiliation data into a usable format.

**Analysis:** We focused on variables indicative of libertarian/authoritarian views, analyzing responses to gauge party affiliates' positions on government involvement in solving societal issues and fiscal conservatism, among other factors.

## Results
Our findings suggest a continued ideological divide between the Democratic and Republican parties along the Libertarian-Authoritarian axis, particularly regarding government's role and fiscal policies. Despite some convergence in specific areas, the parties remain distinct in their core philosophies.
